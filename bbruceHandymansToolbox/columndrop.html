            <h3><strong>If you are unsure...call an electrician!</strong></h3>

            <p>Considering doing some electrical work on your own?  The Internet is a melting pot of tips, suggestions, recommendations and ideas about almost every aspect of human life. There are a lot of do-it-yourself or DIY tips on the Internet which promises that you can actually do almost everything on your own. However, there are instances when things would go beyond what your average hands could do. Sometimes, you will definitely need the help and service of professionals. This is especially true if you are dealing with electricity, electrical wirings, and installations. Indeed, small things like replacing busted light bulbs can already be done by yourself alone, but there are more serious electricity issues in your home that should be handled by an expert.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, you should know when to call an electrician. Basically, if a major wiring installation or replacement needs to be done and you do not have any background or experience in dealing with electrical wirings, then it is best to call an electrician. If you think something is wrong with a wiring in any of the rooms in your house, for example, the bathroom, do not attempt to do it yourself. The bathroom is a part of your house that usually gets wet because of constant use of water. Thus, the occurrence of being grounded and electrocuted is more likely to happen. You should not hastily grab your tools and try to fix it yourself.</p>
            <p>Another instance when you would need the help and expertise of an electrician is when you wish to add extra electrical wiring installations. This would most likely happen if you are to add electrical appliances and fixtures that need separate or additional wirings. If you attempt to do it yourself and did it incorrectly, then you’re in for more serious trouble. See, faulty wiring installations could lead to electrical fires and burns. So to ensure that everything is safe, you should seek the service of an electrician for any major electrical modifications and additions. If anything that has to do with electricity is done haphazardly, it could make way for more dangerous effects and serious troubles that could pose a threat to your household and family.</p>
            <p>Of course, it is still best to hire an electrician especially if you are to deal with major repairs and modifications in your home electrical system. Above all, they know what things, materials, and tools are needed to get the job done. They are also probably trained and have the adequate knowledge on safety measures especially when dealing with electrical systems. Electricians could also give you advice on how to take care of your electrical devices, wirings, and installations to avoid further damages.</p>
            <p>Hiring an electrician requires you to be more cautious and meticulous. You should make sure to hire an electrician that specializes in the area that you need to be done. For example, if you need to have a complete repair or replacement of wirings in a house or property that is already decades old, you should hire someone who has an experience and expertise in fixing electrical wirings of old houses.</p>

            <h3>Electrical Safety</h3>
            <p>Here are a few tips for working safely with electricity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electrical shocks can kill, so don’t do repairs when you’re tired, distracted, or rushed.</li>
                <li>Follow a routine and double-check yourself each step of the way.</li>
                <li>Remember that just because hot wires are supposed to be colored and the neutral wire white, people don’t always follow the rules, especially if they don’t know what they’re doing.</li>
                <li>Double-check to make sure that the appliance is unplugged before you start to work on it.</li>
                <li>Turn off the circuit breaker or unplug the fuse that feeds electricity to the outlet or switch you want to work on. If in doubt, turn off all power to the house.</li>
                <li>Read instructions several times until the sequence is fixed in your mind.</li>
                <li>Examine cords and wires carefully so that you know which part is hot and which is neutral. Colored wires are supposed to be hot and white is neutral.</li>
                <li>Know your plugs. The narrow prong always carries electricity; the wide prong is neutral.</li>
                <li>Never work in or near water with power equipment.</li>
                <li>Don’t open the service panel while standing in water.</li>
                <li>Clearly label wires and bend them, in different directions so that no part of your hot wires accidentally touch each other.</li>
                <li>Check that the power is still off before you twist or splice wires together. Match color to color; don’t cross them.</li>
                <li>Always review each step to make sure you did it right, especially before turning the power back on.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Making safe wire connections</h3>
            <p>The first thing that you want to do before you begin making a wire connection is to make sure that you have turned off the circuit breaker. Even if the circuit breaker has been turned off, you will want to make sure that there’s no electricity running through the wire. Using a non-contact voltage tester, you will be able to confirm that the electricity has stopped. It is also highly recommended that you wear rubber gloves during this process to reduce the possibility of an electrical hazard.</p>
            <p>Second, you want to remove any insulation that may be on the wires. It’s common to use a wire stripper for this. If you’re looking for a new wire stripper, however, I would recommend getting one that can work both as a wire cutter and stripper.</p>

            <p>If you’re unsure of how much insulation you need to strip in order to create a strong and proper electrical connection, you can look on the packaging or the back of the connector itself. </p>
            <p>The type of wire connector that you decide to use can change the way you splice the wire. These include wire nuts, lever connectors, push in connectors, and more. We recommend using a Wago connector, which comes in many different types of connectors. All of them are easy to use no matter which you choose.</p>
            <p>Regardless of what type of connector you decide to use, be sure that you’re creating a strong electrical connection. A loose electrical connection is like a speed bump on the road. It will end up slowing down the electrical current while creating friction and heat. Too loose of a connection can also cause electricity to leap through the air from one conductor to another; this is known as arcing.</p>
            <p>Both of these are fire hazards, so you need to make sure there is a strong connection in order to avoid it. A Wago lever and push in connector feature an opening that lets you check the electric continuity or voltage without removing the wires and this will help when creating a long lasting connection.</p>
