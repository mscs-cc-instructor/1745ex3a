            <p>As you can see in the table to the right, many of the most common wood species you'll find yourself working with can cause some uncomfortable and potentially serious problems. There are some species out there such as Poison Walnut that actually have corrosive sap and Oleander can cause acute cardiac affects!</p>
            <p>The moral of the story is this. Make sure that when working with wood, know it's species and it's affects on the human body. Always, always, always, wear proper protective gear. This includes gloves, dust mask, eye protection, and sometimes even long sleeves and an apron. Protect yourself, there's only one of you.</p>

                <h3>A little bit about wood</h3>
                <p><strong>Janka Hardness</strong></p>
                <p>The Janka scale rates the relative hardness of wood. We have listed some of the most popular choices in wood flooring and included some more exotic species for your reference and comparison.</p>
                <p>The higher the number the harder the wood. These ratings were determined using the Janka Hardness Test  which measures the side hardness measure of the  force required to embed a .444 inch steel ball to half its diameter into the wood. This is one of the best measures of the ability of wood species to withstand denting and wear. It is also a good indicator of how hard a species is to saw or nail.</p>
                <p>This should only be used as a general guide when comparing various species of wood flooring. Depending on where the wood is harvested the results may vary. Plank construction and finish are also important factors when determining the durability and ease of maintenance of any wood floor.</p>
                <p>A wood's relative hardness is determined with the Janka Rating System, which measures the force required to drive a .444 inch steel ball into the wood until half the diameter of the ball is embedded in the wood. </p>
                <p>The Janka Hardness Scale rating has become the industry standard for determining whether a given wood is suitable for flooring material. Red Oak, which has a Janka rating of 1290, is the industry benchmark for comparing the relative hardness of different wood species. </p>
                <p>The majority of hardwoods and many softwoods are durable enough to withstand normal flooring use - especially with proper installation and finishing. However, no matter the Janka rating,  all wood will dent or mar with a hard enough impact .</p>
