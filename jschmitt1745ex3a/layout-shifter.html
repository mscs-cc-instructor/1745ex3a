                    While fermenting vegetables does not require a lot of specialized equipment, using the appropriate equipment can make all the difference when getting started. From a good chopping knife to the right fermentation vessel, you'll want to pick equipment to fit your needs. When choosing your fermentation equipment and supplies, consider your options carefully. Some of our favorites are the Masontops fermentation supplies, which conveniently pair with regular-mouth and wide-mouth mason jars. They are available on their own or as part of Cultures for Health's DIY Fermented Vegetable Kits.
